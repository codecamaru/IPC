# IPC (Human-Computer Interface) - Project
This repo is a Project developed by my colleage Maria and me. The interface was designed by us. 
It simulates a navigation board so that a pilot student can practice for an exam. 
We used NetBeans and SceneBuilder to help us with the interface design. It is developed in JavaFX. 
The main folder is "src"
